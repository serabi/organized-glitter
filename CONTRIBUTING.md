# Contributing to Organized Glitter

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Organized Glitter! This project is a personal investment into the diamond painting community, and I welcome contributions that help make it better for everyone.

## Project Overview

Organized Glitter is a diamond painting project management application that helps crafters track their projects, manage their stash, and document their progress. It's built with React, TypeScript, and currently uses PocketBase as the database.

## How to Contribute

2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment (see README.md)
4. Create a new branch for your changes
5. Make your changes
6. Test your changes
7. Submit a pull request

### Development Setup

# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/organized-glitter.git
cd organized-glitter

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp env.template .env
# Edit .env with your local PocketBase credentials

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

To contribute to this project, you must certify that you have the right to contribute your code. We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) for this purpose.

### What is DCO?

The DCO is a simple way to certify that you wrote or have the right to submit the code you are contributing to the project. (Note: It's fine to use AI to generate code, but please **review all code generated by AI before submitting.** I strongly recommend using the Context7 MCP server to help give your AI the proper context it needs to write TypeSafe, PocketBase compatible code.)

### How to Sign Your Commits

All commits must be signed off to indicate that you agree to the DCO. This is done by adding the `-s` flag to your git commit:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Add new feature for project filtering"
```

This will automatically add a "Signed-off-by" line to your commit message:

```
Add new feature for project filtering

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

### Developer Certificate of Origin Text

By signing off your commits, you certify that:
